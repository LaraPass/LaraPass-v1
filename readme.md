## Project History

Before you download and use this project/app, you must understand the history of it and the reason for making it open source. This project was developed almost 3 years ago and released exclusively on Codecanyon (an envato marketplace). It was developed using PHP 7.1.3 and Laravel 5. Two years later, we began development of the next version of LaraPass (v2) from scratch using improved database design, code quality, better security, multi-lang support and a feature-rich admin management system. With the release of LaraPass v2, this version of LaraPass is no longer maintained/updated (removed from codecanyon). Unfortunately, we have come accross quite a few pirated versions of LaraPass v1 in the wild (with a few new installations in production environments everyday) and while we do not mind it, some of the pirated versions have been found to contain malicious code. To prevent unsuspecting users from suffering any damage due to the malicious code in production, we have decided to release the entire source code on github. Be advised, this is an old version of LaraPass which is no longer being maintained by us. 

If want to try out a much improved, higher quality and feature-rich Password Manager (regularly updated), you can checkout [LaraPass v2](https://larapass.net).
